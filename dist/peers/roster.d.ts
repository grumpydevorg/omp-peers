/**
 * Roster — identity + peer list injected on the host `context` event.
 *
 * The event payload's messages are a provider-bound clone that never reaches
 * the transcript. The note is always injected — even with no peers — so the
 * agent always knows its own peer name; rows degrade to a solo line.
 *
 * The note is rebuilt for every provider request and lands in the latest
 * user message, so any text in it that changes mid-turn invalidates the
 * provider's prompt cache from that message on. It therefore carries only
 * what changes when peers join, leave or rename: never busy/idle, activity
 * or todo counts, which `peer_status` reports on demand.
